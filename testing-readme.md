Testing Intro Practice
Write some tests for a couple of the JavaScript MicroChallenges you worked on earlier this week. Here are some good ones to try.

Remember, try to think of bad inputs that will break your function, not just a bunch of good examples.

Numbers/Conditionals
https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/javascript-micro-challenges/blob/master/110-Conditional.md

Example:
console.log("When I pass in -4 and -9, I expect to get: "The first number was bigger!";
Arrays
https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/javascript-micro-challenges/blob/master/130-LoopsArraysAndConcatenation.md

Example:
console.log("When I pass in ['These', 'are', 'not', 'the', 'droids', 'you', 'are', 'looking', 'for'] and 4, I expect to get: "droids you are looking for"
